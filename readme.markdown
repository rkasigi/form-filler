###Form Filler

A Google Chrome extension that fill dummy text in all input fields in a page. This extension allows you to fill all form inputs (textboxes, textareas, radio buttons, dropdowns, etc.) with dummy data automatically. It is a must for developers who work with forms as it avoids the need for manually entering values in fields.

This project is forked from [husainshabbir/form-filler](https://github.com/husainshabbir/form-filler) with some enhancement.
